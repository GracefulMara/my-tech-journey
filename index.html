          <h2>Hello, I'm Grace Aronu...</h2>
          <p>
            It’s funny to think about it now, but my tech journey actually
            started back in secondary school. I was part of my school’s computer
            society, and that’s where we got introduced to programming using
            things like Arduino, Scratch, and HTML. I didn’t exactly join out of
            deep interest - our coordinator encouraged me to, and I said “okay,
            why not?” It wasn’t bad, so I stuck around.
          </p>

          <p>
            With time, I started to enjoy it a bit more, but I didn’t see it as
            something I’d continue after school. I wanted to be a doctor, and
            tech just felt like a side thing that had nothing to do with that.
          </p>

          <p>
            But by 2nd or 3rd year in med school, I noticed something was up,
            anytime I came across anything tech-related, I’d get really curious.
            Like, my interest would spark, even if I didn’t know what to do with
            it. Around that time, I got into graphics design and started serving
            in the media unit at church. It gave me a creative outlet, but I knew
            I still hadn’t found “it.”

          <p>
            By 4th and 5th year, after watching a bunch of YouTube videos and
            doing some personal digging, I decided to explore web development.
            Graphics gave me a foundation, but I found myself more drawn to how
            websites actually work behind the scenes. I started a course, loved
            it, but school got intense, so I couldn’t finish it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Still, I wasn’t ready to let it go. I had shared my interest with a
            few friends, and one of them told me about Upskill. He even reminded
            me when applications opened. I applied - and here I am.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s been a journey for sure, not smooth, but definitely worth it.
            I’m still figuring things out, like how to mix my love for medicine
            with tech, or how to build tools that solve real problems. But one
            thing I know? Tech is no longer just “that other thing” for me — it’s
            part of the story now, and I’m excited to keep going.
          </p>

          <p>
            That’s my tech story so far. What’s yours? How did your journey into
            tech begin?
